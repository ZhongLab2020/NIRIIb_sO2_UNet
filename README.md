# NIR-IIb Deep Learning-Assisted sO₂ Imaging

This repository contains code for training a U-Net model to segment intestinal vasculature in near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb) images, and reconstruct blood oxygen saturation (sO₂) maps from dual-excitation imaging data.

## Features
- U-Net-based segmentation of vascular structures
- Binary classification of vessels from grayscale TIFF stacks
- Data augmentation using Albumentations
- Dice score tracking and visualization
- Compatible with NIR-IIb imaging experiments
